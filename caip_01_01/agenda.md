## Internal Agenda – CAIP 01 Monday

Focus
- Assume 0 AI/ML background
- Emphasize intuition and visual understanding
- Build foundational comfort before technical rigor

Topics
- AI vs ML vs DL vs GenAI
  - Use the “password length” example
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning (fruit vs customers)
- Over/underfitting analogies:
  - Distracted Dan → not learning enough (underfit)
  - Photocopier Phil → memorizing training data (overfit)
  - Goldilocks → just right

Demo Plan
1. Load dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
2. Split data into train/test
3. Train decision tree or logistic regression
4. Show model score + basic evaluation
5. Emphasize that **you don't need deep math to get started**

Teaching Prompts
- “What do you think the model *learns*?”
- “What would it mean for it to memorize?”
- “Why might the accuracy number lie to you?”
